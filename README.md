## About

This website was made as a project for CCT391, University of Toronto. The website is a final project to illustrate basic PHP functionalities and Javascript interaction. My group and myself decided to recreate a simpler version of Instagram's gallery. Leading to our project "Lookbook", where a dyanmic photo gallery is displayed and user-generated content would be the driver for content. The website consist of user registration and login authentication, likable posts, welcome message, and grid-layout design.

## Final Remarks

This project was a fun way to learn basic php development and javascript interaction. Learning how to use I/O from html forms and connect it to an XML document, is a good start to understanding different php functionality. It would had been nice to integrate Unsplash's API for a dyanmic photo gallery feed but that is for another time. There was not anything too difficult that I created with Javascript beside the simple liking feature and caruosel. Maybe adding a proper like feature and comments, but these features are for another time. Overall, it was a fun little project that helped understand that very basics of both of these languages, and now I can look back and see where I can imrpove on.

## Known Bugs

- Unresponsive web design (Probably because i didn't add meta-viewport tag)
- Writing to XML file is inconsistent
- Weird characters in paragraph content (Probably because i didn't add meta-utf tag)
